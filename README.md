# COMP551Project4
Repository for Project 4


The main repository from the paper can be found at https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer. 
Every code snippet contained in this repository is altered directly from this original.

The code used to generate Table 2 is
- ViT_B_16_augreg (computes accuracy of basic vit model)
- ViT_L16+32_augreg (computes accuracy of larger + hybrid models)

These both should run as Colab notebooks
