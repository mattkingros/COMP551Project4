# COMP551Project4
Repository for Project 4

The main repository from the paper can be found at https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer. 
Every code snippet contained in this repository is altered directly from this original (master) branch.

The code used to generate Table 1 is:
- ViT_B_16_augreg (computes accuracy of basic vit model)
- ViT_L16+32_augreg (computes accuracy of larger + hybrid models)

These both should run as Colab notebooks, with no need to install any additional packages (i.e. can run as-is after hitting the "open in colab" button)

The code used to generate the attention heatmaps is:

- Attention maps

Which again can be run directly in colab.

The code used to generate table 2 is:
